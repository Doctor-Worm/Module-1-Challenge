## Challenges Faced

> - At first, I had trouble getting the updated website rendering correctly out of my remote repo. Everytime I tried loading the webiste, all I could see was the readme file. However after some troubleshooting, I was able to figure out that the indedx.html file needed to be at the first level, and not inside of another folder.
> - I had some issues with merging my local files to the GitHub remote repo, so I ended up force pushing my local repo to the remote GitHub repo to make sure that everything rendered correctly. I knew my local repo was corect, so I was okay with force pushing to the remote repo. However it may have edited my commit history in doing so unfortuntaely. I did take note of everything I edited while refactoring, so hopefully this can help with the lake of commit history.
> - I definitely got much more comfortable using git throughout this project.
